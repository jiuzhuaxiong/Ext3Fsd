    2, Size manipulation and i/o path revised for support of indirect and
       extent-based mappings

       Version 0.53 and previous versions only support up to 2T volume

    4, Deletion acceleration: truncation optimized for indirect-based files
    5, Size-expanding disabled in IRP_MJ_CREATE for better performance.

WARNINGS:
 
    The driver may crash your system and ruin your data unexpectedly,
    since there might be software conflicts and I could only test it
    on some of the popular platforms. You should use it with care and
    use it at your own risk!
